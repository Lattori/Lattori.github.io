      <h2>Race and Intersectionality</h2>

      <p>Hey Everyone, Welcome to my Blog! Let's explore the concept of intersectionality and why it's important. For the last few centuries, Men
        have dominated most societies creating patriarchal societies throughout the world. While this generally benefits a percentage of men, others (specifically marginalized groups) do not receive the same benefits as others. The most common example of this would be LGBTQIA+ men, who are often discriminated against because of their affiliation with queer and transgender communities. Additionally, they are also neglected by society as a whole. An example would be the act of gay marriage, as until a decade or two ago was not legalized and was condemned . Can you think of different ways in which intersectionality affects others and perhaps yourself? Thanks for reading, stay tuned for the next blog post,as it will appear on a weekly basis!

      <h2>How race has affected me personally in my life</h2>
      
      
      
      <p>Today I would like to talk about the challenges that occur to my racial identity. For context I am a black American, who currently lives and resides in the United States of America. One of the main challenges that I have is prejudice. Prejudice is the idea of being discriminated against because of the color of your skin, rather than your morals or character. This form of racial discrimination can be incredibly challenging, as it leads to a false narrative that oftentimes is objectively false. Another challenge I face as a black American is wealth. Traditionally, black Americans' have often been of lower class and do not have the same opportunity of wealth as the majority do. Additionally, the median household income tends to be quite low. Finding ways to raise my income is especially important to me as I want to be financially free and relieve stress.Thanks for reading this blog post, as it is quite personal. See you next time!</p>

    on previous topics is very important to me,as I can look back in retrospect and see the amazing progress I've made in
    only 5 weeks! Thanks for reading this blog post, and I will see you in the next one!!!

  <h2>Flip Discussions in SOC119N</h2>
  <p>Hello Everyone and welcome to our blog! The discussion this week relates to Flip discussions
    in our classrooms.For context, flip is a debate platform where students can responding
    to a particular topic and other students follow the discussion.At first I was incredibly worried about
    flip discussions getting out of hand, but alot of us where in agreement with particular topics,which made debates less stressful.
    Ultimately though, I am glad to hear other perspectives from my own, as it broadens my viewpoints
    and makes me more holistic as a person. Thanks for reading this blog! Next week will be the final week! See you then!
